# Introduction


Controllers provide a unified interface for integrating various AI services into your node and javascript applications. They simplify access to advanced functionalities like language processing, image generation, speech synthesis, and vision, abstracting away the complexities of managing different AI providers and models.

### Controllers Types 

Intellinode framework includes several types of controllers, each tailored to a specific AI domain:

- **Embedding Controller**: Manages the generation of text embeddings, useful for semantic search and clustering tasks.
- **Language Generation Controller**: Allows for generating human-like text based on prompts or conversations, supporting various language models.
- **Image Generation Controller**: Creates images from textual descriptions through image generative models.
- **Speech Synthesis Controller**: Converts text to audible speech, offering support for multiple languages and dialects.
- **Vision Controller**: Processes images to generate textual descriptions, detect objects, and analyze scenes.
